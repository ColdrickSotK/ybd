# YBD
YBD aims to show improvements on/for Baserock morph:
- smaller, simpler codebase
- concentrate on core functionality
  - just build and cache first, then deploy
  - no branch|checkout|edit|merge
- much faster calculation of build-order
  - currently a couple of seconds
- much faster calculation of cache-keys
  - currently a couple of seconds, once git mirrors are present
  - currently uses trees (hence needs git mirrors)
- run on non-Linux environments (eg Mac OS)
- drop the words morph, morphology, stratum, chunk from the Baserock vocabulary
  - run morph-converter.sh on a checkout of definitions.git to do the renaming
- instead just deal with generic definitions and components
  - a definition may have components and build-dependencies
  - components are just a list of definitions
  - build-dependencies are just a list of definitions too
  - support for nested definitions
  - a component may contain no code (could be just videos for example)
  - a component may be a tarball
  - may have multiple versions of a component, eg
    - foo|aa and foo|bb installed
    - foo|cc and foo|dd used as build-dependencies by other component
- ability to build any level of component
  - an individual software component (what we've called chunks until now)
  - a logically-coupled set of components (what we've called strata)
  - a bootable collection of sets of components (what we've called systems)
- ability to deploy any level of component (this is controversial...)
- possible for users to understand and diagnose the cache naming scheme
- no need for workspaces
- permissive and fast for day-to-day engineering
- but still guarantee traceability and reproducibility

TODO:
- get it to actually build things
- isolation of build staging environment
  - ideally not dependent on Linux chroot
- creation of real cache artifacts
- arch
- distributed build
- remote cache
- deploy
